# Podcast-App

A podcast discovery app made in one day during Salt bootcamp's "hackday". 

Features: Search for keyword in the title of podcast episodes, add Podcast episode in a "For later listening" list, click on episode cover to see details about podcast, and listen to whole episodes in-app.

To run this project, you will need a valid API token for the Listen Notes Podcast API. Runs with a npm install and npm start.
